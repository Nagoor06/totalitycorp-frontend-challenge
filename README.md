## Shopping Web App with React
Welcome to the shopping web app Totality built with React! This web application offers an extensive selection of clothing and footwear for women, men, and kids, along with various accessories. I've incorporated user-friendly features such as filtering by brand and category, an efficient shopping cart, and a wishlist functionality to enhance your shopping experience. The app also automatically calculates the total cost of items in your cart.
